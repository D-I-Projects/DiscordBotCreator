Concept

Adding a Slash Command
- The command is written in a `commands.py` file. All commands are organized in classes so that they load quickly when the server launches.
- Inside the `commands.py` file, each command should be fully described, including its name and functionality.

Starting the Program
- The `launcher.py` file reads the `commands.py` file to retrieve all necessary information about the commands. It loads all commands and launches the Discord Bot.

Deleting a Slash Command
- The GUI will load all commands from the `commands.py` file and display them with their names (e.g., `/(name)`). Users can select a command to access its configuration page, and there should be an option to delete the command at the bottom of this page.

Token
- The bot token is read from a `bot_token.py` file. The code for this is already written.

Bot Events
- We should add event handling, such as actions taken when the bot receives a private message or when a new user joins the server.

Presence
- The bot should have a customizable presence, such as "Playing Destiny" - https://discord.gg/A5reDWGkhV - D&I Bot. This should be straightforward to implement.

Command Types
- Simple response commands.
- Multiple choice commands with or without autocomplete.

Templates
- There should be a few template commands available at the first release, such as `/ping`. More templates will be added over time.

Watermark
- All Discord bots created with our software will include a slash command (`/info`) that provides information about the DiscordBotCreator version and other relevant details.
- It is prohibited to remove or tamper with this command. By accepting the license and using our software, you agree that it is illegal to remove this watermark.
